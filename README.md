# CardiacSegV2_gradcam

This project is based on the original code from [beckylei](https://github.com/beckylei/CardiacSegV2). The code has been modified to apply **Grad-CAM** for **model interpretability** and visualization of the model's decision-making process on cardiac muscle segmentation tasks.
